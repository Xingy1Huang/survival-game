        On a sunny day Alice and her sister went out on a walk in the fields and as
        her sister was reading a book, Alice got very bored. Suddenly she saw a white
        bunny that was in a hurry. She was so curious and went after the bunny. The
        bunny went through a hole in a tree trunk and Alice followed him. Suddenly she
        found herself falling in a very deep well. Finally, she landed and saw a long
        corridor in front of her and started to walk where she saw many locked doors
        and the bunny disappeared. She saw a little golden key on a table that fitted
        a small door behind the curtain. She opened the door and saw a beautiful
        forest, but she couldn't fit through the door.

        Alice notices a bottle in the table next to the key; she took the bottle and
        drank it. As she drank the potion she began to shrink. She got small and went
        through the door, where she saw the bunny again. The bunny asked her to bring
        his gloves and hand fan from his house. Alice went to the bunny's house and
        found his gloves, hand fan and also saw a bottle of potion on the table. She
        thought the potion would bring her to normal size and she drank it. Suddenly
        she became so big, the animals around the house started to throw stones inside
        the house. The stones thrown turned into small cakes. When Alice ate those
        cakes she started to shrink and got out of the house. But, she was upset as
        she was so small. On the way, she saw a blue caterpillar in the mushroom and
        asked the caterpillar what can she do to get back to her normal size? The
        caterpillar said that one side of the mushroom its standing will make her grow
        and the other side will make her shrink. By eating both the mushroom she
        managed to come back to her normal size.

            alt="Alice at a tea party" class="left" />
        Alice started to walk on the path where she saw a cat with a big smile; she
        asked the cat what's his name and where this path leads. The cat said itâ€™s a
        Cheshire cat and the path leads to the Man Hatter and March Hare. After the
        little chat, the Cheshire cat disappeared slowly starting from his tail, only
        its face remained. Alice found the March Hare who was having tea with the Mad
        Hatter under a tree. She also saw a Dormouse sleeping in between them. When
        they saw Alice coming they opposed saying that there is no space available.
        But Alice said there was plenty of room. Man Hatter said if she wants to stay
        she has to answer a riddle. He asked Alice "why the crow looks like the desk".
        She asked him "why do you think". He replied, "I don't know". Alice got upset
        with their stupid jokes and went away.

        Alice continued to walk, on the way she saw a tree with a door. She found a
        golden key which opened the door to a beautiful garden. Alice was very
        surprised to see the guards of the Queen of the hearts painting all the white
        roses to red as their queen doesn't like white roses and all the guards looked
        like playing cards. Right At that moment, the Queen came to the garden and
        invited Alice to play croquet. Alice was shocked to see hedgehogs used as
        balls and flamingos were used as Croco mullets in the game. Suddenly there was
        a fight between the players. The Queen got upset so she canceled the croquet
        party and headed towards the court.

        The trial was about a jack of hearts who had stolen a pie from the Queen's
        kitchen. The king yelled from his seat "call the first witness". The first
        witness was Mad Hatter. When he started to talk, Alice suddenly started to
        grow. The rabbit called for Alice to take the witness stand. The queen of
        hearts asked Alice to tell everything that she knows. "I don't know anything"
        Alice answered. The queen yelled seriously "you don't know, chop her head
        off". Alice got very upset and shouted. Suddenly the king, queen, and all the
        playing cards started to fly towards Alice and became a big whirlpool of
        cards.

        Finally, with the leaves flying all around her, she found herself on the field
        again. Her sister called out Alice to wake up as she was in deep sleep. When
        Alice woke up she realized that everything was a dream. She said to herself
        that it was an amazing dream.
